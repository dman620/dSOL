##The readme (for Derek's Simple Open License)
Hello, I made this repository to keep my license that I wrote for my own purposes.
It is also available to copy for anyone that wants to.  The reason I wrote my own instead of using a pre existing license is because I would rather spend time learning to create a license than spend my time mastering one that somebody else wrote.

It is called the short open license because I wrote it to be short and easy to understand.  I also wanted to outline a few rules for the use of my software that I want to be honored.

That's about it.  What you see is what you get.
